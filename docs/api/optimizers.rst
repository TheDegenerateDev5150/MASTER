Optimizers Package
==================

The module provides Riemannian optimization algorithms for TensorFlow and its Keras API. These optimizers adapt standard methods to manifold settings by projecting gradients onto tangent spaces, retracting updates back onto the manifold, and optionally using vector transport to handle adaptive schemes.
